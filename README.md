# registros_public_version
We developed this code within the Executive Commission for Victim Assistance. Before I joined the Victims Registry, staff manually completed each document, person by person. Our goal was to streamline the process and reduce the waiting time for victims seeking their registry documents, which grant them access to the rights established under the Victims' Law.
