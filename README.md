# registros_public_version
We developed this code in the Ejecutiv Comission of Victim Care. Before I came to the Victims Registry, staff manually completed each document, person by person. We wanted to improve the process and decrease the time victims had waited to get their victim registry document, which allows them to access the rights comtempered in the Law of Victims.
